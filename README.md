# Simple-Thermosensation-Assay

Schematics and instructions for creating a simple two-choice temperature preference assay used in  Miner et al., 2025 to assess heat avoidance.

Schematics and laser cutter settings can be found in ThermosensationAssay.pdf or ThermosensationAssay.ai. We thank Ofer Mazor at the Harvard Medical School Research  Instrumentation Core for the design and construction of this assay.

The protocol used to run the assay can be found in ThermosensationAssayProtocol.pdf

## Parts

Black acrylic for bottom and sides:  3/16" black acrylic McMaster-Carr #8505K748

Clear acrylic for top: 1/8" clear acyrlic McMaster-Carr #8589K12

Aluminum plates cut to 2" x 2.25" such as McMaster-Carr #8975K53

Screw and thumbnuts for securing the behavior chamber top to the base, such as McMaster-Carr #92741A100 and #92314A110

4 threaded acrylic rod (legs) and screws (any, we used rods that let the assay sit ~2" off the ground) OR 4 threaded on one end studs, such as McMaster-Carr #97042A148 
   NOTE: You will have to adjust the screw holes on the laser cutting file depending on your choice.

Polyimide flexible heating strip: Omega PFH-2/2-36 https://www.omega.com/en-us/industrial-heaters/flexible-heaters/pfh-series/p/PFH-2-2-36

Temperature controller: Omega CN16D3-R-DC https://www.omega.com/en-us/control-and-monitoring-devices/controllers/pid-controllers/cnd3-series/p/CN16D3-R-DC

24V and 9V Power Supply (Any)

Metallic Tape (Any)

Thermocouple and Digital Thermometer (Any)

## Assembly
1. Laser cut the black acrylic (bottom and sides) and clear acrylic (top) according to the specifications in the laser cutter files.
   a. There are two options for the top chamber design: the barbell and the rectangle. We found the barbell retricts movement between the two sides of the area substantially more than the rectangle design. The       rectangle design was used in Miner et al. 2025
   b. Check the size of the screw holes in the base depending on your choice of legs and screws.
2. Attach the legs to the base.
3. Sit the aluminum plates in the base.
4. Attach the heating pad to the bottom of one plate. Hook up the temperature controller and power supplies.
5. Sit the acrylic behavior chamber on top of the completed base and secure with hex nuts. You should be able to loosen the nut to slide the the clear acrylic top back and forth to expose or close the fly-loading hole.
6. Attach a thermocouple to each aluminum plate with metallic tape.

Optional: You can add to this set up lights for optogenetics and a commercial consumer camera to record behavior, if desired. See below for examples.
